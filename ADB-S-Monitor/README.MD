# ADB-S Monitor

ADB-S Monitor is a tool designed to monitor and manage aircraft that are transmitting frequencies overhead.

## Understanding DF Codes (Downlink Format)

In Mode S and ADS-B communication, each packet contains a **Downlink Format (DF)** field ‚Äî a 5-bit value that identifies the message type being transmitted by the aircraft.

Below is a breakdown of the most common DF codes and their meanings:

| DF Code | Name                            | Description                                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0‚Äì4     | Short Surveillance Replies       | Legacy SSR radar-related responses                                          |
| 5       | Surveillance ID Reply            | Contains squawk (transponder) code                                          |
| 11      | All-Call Reply                   | Broadcast of ICAO address (used during Mode S interrogations)              |
| 16      | Long Surveillance Reply          | Rare; typically used in radar systems                                       |
| **17**  | **ADS-B Extended Squitter**      | Primary ADS-B messages: position, altitude, velocity, callsign              |
| 18      | ADS-B via UAT                    | Used in 978 MHz band (not applicable on 1090 MHz)                           |
| 19      | Extended Squitter (non-position) | Used for velocity, aircraft category, or status                             |
| 20‚Äì22   | Comm-B Replies                   | Contain BDS (Broadcast Datalink Subset) data like TCAS or intent            |
| 24      | Comm-D Extended Reply            | Rare; used for extended communication data                                  |
| 25‚Äì31   | Reserved or Undefined            | Reserved for future use or may indicate corrupted or malformed messages     |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This decoder focuses exclusively on DF=17 messages (ADS-B Extended Squitter)**  
> These are the most valuable packets, containing:
> - ICAO address  
> - Callsign  
> - Altitude  
> - Velocity and heading  
> - Position (latitude and longitude via CPR decoding)

All other DF types are ignored by default unless specifically enabled or supported.

## üì° Reaper Net - Tactical SIGINT Targets & Triggers

Reaper Net is designed for modular signal intelligence (SIGINT) in the field. In addition to ADS-B decoding, the system can be extended to monitor and react to a wide variety of radio signals. This document outlines useful signal targets, detection methods, and actionable triggers.

**Why use subprocess and not pyhackrf?**

Because pyhackrf does not work. Thanks but no thanks.

**What is the range of this application?**

It is all based on your location and antenna. The distance will most likely be more than you would need. With this said, below are some testing results bwith the longest distance seen.

- Indoors with a crappy antenna: 9 Miles
- Same crappy antenna in a window: 30 Miles
- Roof mounted antenna 80 Miles

All examples was with no gain.
